# Prestashop-web-automation
The project includes automated tests for the website demo.prestashop.com. The job specification wasn't very clear -  it wasn't obvious whether the cart existed or the "buy" button took the user directly to the ordering page. That's why in addition to the main task, I implemented several extra checks: 
- continue shopping / go to cart (pop-up when adding an item to the cart)
- removing goods from the cart.
